### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem includes the questions like whether a student will get an admit or not. What are the parameters for solutions in the university? What is the probability of being selected by the university? And can it be mathematically expressed? In this case, our objective is to predict whether a student will get an admit or not and the probability of getting admitted based on selection criteria.

### OBJECTIVES:
- It helps student for making decision for choosing a right college.
- Here the chance of occurrence of error is less when compared with the existing system.
- It is fast, efficient and reliable.
- Avoids data redundancy and inconsistency.
- Easy accessibility of data.

### TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:

•	First, the data set that contains the information about previous years' admission criteria was collected and fed in the system for preprocessing as a .CSV file.
<br> •	Then with the help of the data set , the model is trained and tested for expected input values by methods like KNN algorithm and regression techniques.
<br> •	Finally , with the help of the user interface, inputs from the user is obtained and prediction is done by the model and output is given.

### ADVANTAGES:
•	It helps students in making decisions for choosing the right college.<br>
•	Here the chance for error occurrence is very low.<br>
•	It is fast, reliable, and efficient.<br>
•	It is very User-Friendly.<br>
•	Easy accessibility of data.<br>
•	Avoids data redundancy and inconsistency.

### DISADVANTAGES:
•	Required active internet connection.<br>
•	System will provide inaccurate results if data is entered incorrectly.

### CONCLUSION:
In this project, we have developed a model to get the details from the students who want to choose a college for their higher studies. The students should enter details such as GRE score, TOFEL score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research details. As we have already trained the model with the dataset containing the previous year’s admission details, this model predicts whether the student has the possibility to get admitted to college or not. If the students’ scores satisfy the admission criteria, the result is shown as he/she has the chance to get admitted to the selected university. Else the result is shown as he/she doesn’t have the chance to get admitted to the selected university.
